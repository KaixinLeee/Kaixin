## Sketches

### UltrasoundTest

An Arduino sketch to test the Ultrasound Sensor connected to the Arduino

### VariableBlurTest

A Processing sketch to test a blur effect that is can be varied by changing a parameter.

### LoadingImages

A Processing sketch demonstrating the process to load images for debugging.

### BlurImage

A Processing sketch which applies a variable blur filter to an image.
